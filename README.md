# HTML-Components-Study

Few experiments with HTML components, which is a way to encapsulate few functionnaties of HTML/JS/CSS into
a single component that can be added to an HTML page, just any other HTML tag.

* salutations
   Few  very basic components, just to start with the HTML Component technology 

* pie_chart
   Pie Chart tag, which will display an array of number passed as parameter to the component.
   The component is using div sections and CSS' clipPath function, to mask the required parts of the component, 
   so that only a pie chart section can be visible.
   
* graph-bar
   Component using the HTML/JS canvas drawing to render data passed as parameter to the component.
